## Bootstrap based Newsweek copy

The aim of this project was to copy https://www.newsweek.com/

See my solution here: https://kaliberpoziomka.github.io/newsweek-bootstrap/

I decided not to build the whole site, because there was a lot of content and repetetive patterns there.
I focused on the top layout (there was nothing new later on the page), resposiveness and learning how to use Bootstrap framework.
Using bootstrap was not convenient for me at first. I dont like separation of styles between my index file and css files.
After some I spend with this framework I see that it can really speed up biulding a website.
I noticed that building custom framework can really speed up teams work.

### SASS

I also learned sass thanks to this project, and loved it!
Really liked .sass syntax and whole functionality of this preprocessor.

Project made thanks to https://www.theodinproject.com/
